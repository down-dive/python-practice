# Log Even Nums
# In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that prints even numbers from 0 to a given number.

## Instructions

#  - Print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive.
# - e.g. given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

#  ```bash
#        0
#        2
#        4
#        6

def evenNums(num):
    for number in range(num):
        return number

print(evenNums(10))
